\arguments{
\item{node_id}{Node ID of the node whose parent ID is to be determined}

\item{tree_info_df}{Data frame containing information about the structure of the decision tree, which is built like a "treeInfo()" data frame from the package "ranger"}

\item{train_data_df}{Data frame of the training data with which the random forest was trained}

\item{test_data_df}{Data frame of the test data (only needed, if show_coverage = TRUE)}

\item{rf_list}{Random forest, which is built like the one you get from ranger()}

\item{tree_number}{Number of the decision tree of the rf_list to be displayed}

\item{dependent_var}{Name of the column of the dependent variable in training data}

\item{show_sample_size}{Option to display percentage of observations that reach nodes during training (TRUE or FALSE)}

\item{show_prediction_nodes}{Option to display prediction in all nodes (TRUE or FALSE)}

\item{show_uncertainty}{Option to display uncertainty quantification in terminal nodes (for now only available for regression)}

\item{show_coverage}{Option to display marginal coverage (only in combination with show_uncertainty = TRUE)}

\item{show_intervalwidth}{Option to display interval width uncertainty quantification in terminal nodes (only in combination with show_uncertainty = TRUE)}

\item{survival_forest}{Empty terminal nodes for survival}

\item{vert_sep}{Vertical spacing of nodes in mm (parameter from Latex package "forest")}

\item{hor_sep}{Horizontal spacing of nodes in mm (parameter from Latex package "forest")}
